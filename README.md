## History
This game is about an ordinary night on the town. You have to fight against everyone who tries to ruin the evening. If you fail to do so, you end up getting kicked out of the bar and the game is lost. If you manage to stay in the bar through three rounds, you win the game.

Good luck!

## How to play Resten Ringer:
The game is played by using the WASD keys to move the player around the bar. The arrow keys determine which direction you shoot.
